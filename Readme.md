# Vat Checker

This module checks a customers VAT number with the 
[Offical VIES database](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/vies/).

If the customer has a valid VAT number, the customer will be added to a (chosen) customer group.

If a customer is not from the EU, nothing will happen.
If a  customer is from the same country as your shop, nothing will happen.
So this module is made according to the european intra-Community supply rules.
